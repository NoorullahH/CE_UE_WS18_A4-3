# Where i Live
*By Francisco Litvay*

I live in the **Evangelisches Studentenheim**.
Evangelisches Studentenheim, or shortly **ESH**, is a dorm in **Julius Raab Straße, Linz, Austria**
It is 5 Stories tall and is very distinct because there is a big boat hanging in front of it.
Some advantages of living here:
* It stands in a very priviledged location. 
	* Near Billa and Hofer for shopping
	* Near Pleschinger See for leisure
	* Near Uni for studying
	* Near Further Weg and Schumpeterstraße for public transportation
	* Near the gas station for emergencies
* The rooms are cheap compared to other dorms
* The community is remarkably united. Foodsharings and other events happen often
* The administration is very considerate

I can only recommend this place. If you would like to know more, look at their [website](https://www.esh.jku.at)
